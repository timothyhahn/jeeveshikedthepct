Upon arriving in Ashland, I found out that my previous hiking partner, Cool Rocks, was also in
Ashland, albeit going southbound. I wanted to meet up with her, but I had slightly inflamed tonsils
and a sore throat, so before hanging out I made sure to get a covid test. It came out negative and
she insisted it would be alright, so later that evening we ordered pizza to her room and caught up
on everything that had happened since we last hiked together. The next day, I was supposed to get a
ride with Cool Rocks out of town, but my throat hurt even more so I texted her to go on without me.
I visited a local doctor who verified I was negative for both covid and strep. While he confirmed my
tonsils were slightly enlarged and my throat was irritated, he also said he doubted I had an
illness, and figured that breathing in wildfire smoke was instead the cause of my issues. As rain
was continuing to fall on Oregon, he assured me that the air quality should improve soon and
encouraged me to continue hiking.
