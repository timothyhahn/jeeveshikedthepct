In order to catch up to my trail family, I would need to hike about 25 miles a day. Unfortunately, the Sierra Nevadas
had some of the most elevation gain and loss on the entire trail, outside of parts of Washington. With that in mind, I
practically ran out of Vermillion Valley Resort, towards Goodale Pass, and met Zosha on one of her horses. We chatted
briefly, but I had a goal in mind and bid goodbye.

My friend Elleen, who had helped me out so much early on the trail, was doing the John Muir Trail southbound. As the PCT
and JMT intersected for significant portions, I knew that if I made it 20 miles that day, despite not starting until
around 11 AM that day, I could reach Purple Lake, where we should be able to meet up.

Goodale Pass was short, but surprisingly steep, and on the descent I managed to slip a few times, before reminding
myself to be careful as I was now on my own. As I pushed myself hard to make up the miles to Purple Lake, almost running
on some ascents, I got a satellite message from my trail family that they weren't going to Yosemite and that I shouldn't
ask why.

As I was too proud to ask them to slow down for me, I said nothing about my plans to catch up to them and recalculated
that I'd need to be pushing a bit over 30 miles a day to catch them before Sonora Pass. I arrived at Purple Lake as the
sun began to set, and Elleen and I caught up before exhaustion sent us to our tents.

The next morning's sunrise found me racing down towards Red's Meadow, my knees pounding. Many hikers get off at Red's
Meadow to resupply at the ski town of Mammoth, but as I had resupplied the day before at VVR, I packed out extra
burgers, and only gave myself a little bit of time to catch my breath.

I threaded my way through the crowds who were visiting Devil's Postpile, and the dusty trail clung to me, filling my
nostrils. On the long climb up to Thousand Island Lake, I passed by Bandit and her group. I was also briefly joined by
Shapes, who I hadn't seen since the beginning of the Sierras, and his friend Zorro, who asked me to join their group.
Determined, however, I continued hiking well past them, even as the sun began to set.

Just as the darkness settled, I met a woman stomping down the trail to me. I asked her how the campsites were at
Thousand Island Lake. In reply, she demanded if I had seen "them". I had no idea who she meant, and she introduced
herself as Pitstop, looking for her fellow hikers Moo and Danger Noodle. They had planned to camp together just ahead,
but the other two hadn't shown up.

I had nothing to offer, so I continued my climb up the pass, exhausted beyond belief. As I climbed, I ate the food I had
packed out. If anyone would have seen me, it would have been an amusing sight - with me huffing and puffing while eating
a burger. Instead, the darkness hid me well and I didn't see any traces of other hikers until I made it to the border of
legal dispersed camping at Thousand Island Lake. This was my first day hiking over 30 miles and setting up camp was a
challenge due to exhaustion and wind.

Island Pass flew by, as did the climb to Donohue. This marked the entry to Yosemite, as well as the beginning of the end
of the Sierras. On top of Donohue, I ran into Wild Child, and we reminisced a bit, before I continued my way down to
Tuolumne Meadows, grateful for the gentle trail.

Past Tuolumne Meadows, I carefully ran across a busy road carrying 4th of July celebrators. As there was a camping ban
around Tuolumne Meadows, I needed to push myself once again to make my miles. Just past the camping boundary I
spotted a small path leading up to a ledge. On the ledge was a perfect little campsite and I crashed into just my
sleeping pad and bag, grateful to be in bed before it got fully dark.

The next day started optimistic, but reality started to catch up to me as a few climbs later I was finding my pace slow
dramatically. I took one of the first breaks I took on this stretch of trail and a hiker I had briefly met back at
Kennedy Meadows, Cooking Mama, caught up to me. We hung out for a bit, before he raced ahead and I crawled my way up
Benson Pass.

I saw almost no one for the rest of the day, until I neared the top of the pass. A little bit from the top, a young
woman caught up to me and seeing me struggle, cheered me on. Once we reached the top, we found Cooking Mama, who
introduced the young woman as his hiking partner, Magma.

Magma, Cooking Mama, and I chatted for a while, and they also asked if I wanted to join them. While I thoroughly enjoyed
their company, I needed to keep pressing on. When they pulled off to camp at the beautiful Smedberg Lake, I tripped my
way down the other side of the pass and camped in what was definitely the birthplace of all mosquitoes.

Cooking Mama and Magma caught up to me early the next day, and the next two passes, Seavey and Dorothy Lake, were
mercifully gentle. I had planned to camp just past Dorothy Lake, but the lake itself was so stunning that I cut my day a
few miles short and enjoyed my evening for the first time since leaving VVR.

Just past Dorothy Pass was the 1,000-mile marker on the PCT. I wanted to celebrate this achievement, but the mosquitoes
had come back in fury, so I instead focused on making it to Sonora Pass. Looking behind me I could see Yosemite, and
behind that the High Sierras. Looking forward, I could see the reddish mountains of Northern California.

The approach to Sonora was treacherous, covered by snow on slim ledges, but the thought of catching up to my trail
family pushed me forward. At Sonora Pass, I was lucky enough to get a quick hitch to Kennedy Meadows North, where I was
able to surprise Ant Man, Black Widow, Willow, and Giggles. I was also able to grab dinner with Floss, before I found
out that my group was already planning to leave on an earlier shuttle back and I'd need to catch up again.

As I was leaving a few hours after them, Cooking Mama and Magma showed up. Once again, they asked if I'd join them, but
I decided that I'd keep pushing forward, catching the group again at South Lake Tahoe.

Despite my best efforts, Cooking Mama and Magma caught up to me again at the saddle between Stanislaus and
Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forests. We were welcomed to Northern California with the heavy smell of wildfire smoke,
which made hiking tough. Despite that, I was hopeful I could catch up to my group as I had been able to pull off some
very high mileage days. Instead, I found out that they were still another 5 miles ahead of me when I finally called it
for the evening.

The next few days repeated this loop, with me pushing my hardest to catch up, only for my trail family to be just ahead.
Again, I knew I could have asked for them to wait for me, but my pride pushed me into telling them to "make it a
challenge", one that I kept failing. Instead, I ended up hanging out more with Cooking Mama and Magma, whose incredible
hiking speed always had them passing me each day and setting up camp well before I was done for the day.

Despite basically running out of food, I was also thankfully able to meet two day hikers on the other side of Carson
Pass, who gave me trail mix and granola bars. This would be enough to get me to Highway 50, and a hitch to South Lake
Tahoe.

The trail again became swarmed by mosquitoes as I joined the Tahoe Rim Trail along the Upper Truckee River. I pushed
through, driven mad with itchiness and smoke inhalation. As wildfires had started to intensify, many hikers I met in
this section announced their intentions to quit once they reached South Lake Tahoe.

Eventually, however, I made it to Highway 50 and a minivan dropped me off at the hostel my trail family was staying at.
The reunion was happy, but brief, as we swapped plans and realized we'd be splitting up once again.
