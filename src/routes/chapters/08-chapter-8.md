In 2020, more than 300,000 acres of Northern California were burned by the Bear Fire. In 2021, an additional 950,000
acres burned in the Dixie Fire. Combined, they led to several fatalities and injuries and upended the lives of many
people who called Northern California their home.

More than a hundred miles of the PCT ran directly through these burns from Quincy to Old Station. While they had since
reopened, hiking through wasn't officially sanctioned. In general, hiking through a burn is technically risky, with
collapsing trees and falling branches being responsible for quite a few deaths throughout history. Sleeping in burns is
an even riskier proposition, as most campsites are directly at risk of trees falling on you.

While we had hiked through several burns at this point, most were relatively short. This meant that we could simply plan
our hiking through these sections to avoid the most dangerous behaviors. This burn, however, would require several days
to hike through, leaving us at risk for several days.

Willow and Lefty were undecided about what to do. Ant Man and Black Widow wanted to skip some of the worst parts of the
burn. Giggles, however, wanted to do as much as she could. Surprisingly, I also wanted to.

While Giggles and I didn't always see eye to eye, the group felt more comfortable about us hiking through the burns if
we hiked together, so after grabbing dinner with a coworker, Giggles and I left South Lake Tahoe and entered the
Desolation Wilderness.

For a few dozen miles, we followed the Tahoe Rim Trail, along the shores of Aloha Lake and Lake Tahoe, before turning
northwards. Here, my mosquito protection started to fail me, and I reached our first campsite driven mad by their bites.

Leaving the Sierras, the views were still beautiful, but lacked the grandeur of the high peaks I had just spent the last
few weeks hiking through. The trail led through meadows and out of season ski resorts, where we set up camp under some
ski lifts.

The day after we reached the infamous Donner Pass, where hikers are offered a free 40oz from the ranch. The ranch also
had a buddy board, where people could leave each other drinks. I left a few drinks for hikers I hadn't seen in a while
that I knew were behind me, and we trudged through sewer filled tunnels underneath Highway 80, before climbing towards
the Peter Grubb's hut. As we did not have a reservation, we quickly peeked inside before camping at the springs just
past it.

Giggles and I pushed hard to try and get to her first 30 mile day, but the day found us taking longer breaks than we
thought. I also was bit by an unleashed dog, but as it didn't break skin, I let the owners know I was fine and we hiked
on. Shortly after this, the trail became mostly scree and every step went from manageable to excruciatingly painful.

The scree continued until Sierra City, where we walked the road into town and I found that my resupply box was missing.
I did my best to resupply at the local store, but finding solid sources of protein was difficult. Giggles and I were
planning to next resupply at Chester in 6 days, but I was skeptical about my chances. I decided to make the best of the
store, however, and purchased ice cream for the other hikers sitting outside the store.

While we cleaned up a bit, I was reunited with Aquawoman, who I last saw at VVR, and Butters, who I last saw in Julian.
We hiked out together, and we once again returned to incredibly painful scree.

The other three were well ahead of me, so I navigated by myself around some very angry campers as I got close to the top
of the hill. On the other side, as darkness settled, I heard a voice call my name out, and Giggles guided me to where we
were camping for the evening.

Much later in the evening, we were awoken by two headlamps, who then decided to setup camp right in between myself and
Butters. They also prepared and ate dinner next to us, meaning we were kept up fairly late. This led to some trail drama
between Butters and the two hikers, McMansion and Honeybee, that I'd hear about for months.

Northern California was shaping up to be surprisingly tough, due to the scree, but some well positioned trail magic
lifted my spirits. Aquawoman was also gifted an entire half of a watermelon, and did her best to scarf it down on her
own. As a tiny petite woman, she ended up looking as though she had grown pregnant overnight.

The next evening, as I was a few miles back from the rest of the group, I turned the corner only to be stopped by an
extremely loud noise. I had initially thought this was a car backfiring, but soon realized that someone was firing into
the woods, likely target practicing. I called out a "cease fire", but was only met with laughter, followed by continued
shots, albeit farther away from me.

Panicked, I climbed far up the ledge to my left, and though the shots had stopped, I set up camp on some rocks well
above the trail. I messaged Giggles with what had happened, and tried to coax myself to sleep.

With several days of poor sleep, I was starting to notice the lack of recovery. My feet were trashed, and every step was
pure agony. As we were still a few days away from Chester, I let Giggles know i needed to pull off trail to the town of
Quincy, and we parted ways. The rest of the group was nervous, but I reassured them that she was in good hands with
Butters and Aquawoman.

In Quincy, I was briefly reunited with Yeezus, who helped me bring my groceries back to my hotel. I rested an extra day,
and on my way out I saw Cooking Mama. He had temporarily been joined by his girlfriend and Magma had temporarily been
joined by her father, so they weren't hiking together at the moment, but planned to reunite later down the trail.

I left Quincy and almost immediately walked into the burn. The effects of the burn were severe, and in some ways this
was a positive in terms of safety, as so much was burned that there was little to fall on me. The trail went steeply
downhill to the tiny outpost of Belden, only to climb steeply out the other end through more burn and plenty of poison
oak.

My feet were still aching, so I took the next few days slowly, with Ant Man and Black Widow eventually catching up and
passing me. At some point, I left the geologic end of the Sierra Nevadas and entered the Cascade Range, which would be
the remainder of the PCT.

The burn was deeply depressing and most nights I camped alone in spots where I wasn't entirely sure if I was safe. A few
miles before I would reach Chester, my original campsite plan of Soldier Creek turned out to be a moot point, as it was
surrounded by trees threatening to collapse at any moment. Oddly enough, someone had set up a tent there, and I quickly
left once I heard them cackling to themselves.

A little bit down the trail, I crossed the midpoint of the entire PCT, and did my best to take a celebratory photograph
at the halfway mark of my journey. I was still a little rattled by the camper at Soldier Creek, however, and my feet
were killing me. I was also very nervous about where to camp that evening, as much of the remainder of the trail between
here and Chester were offlimits for camping.

Passing through private cow fields that graciously allowed hikers to pass through, I entered national forest territory
and checked my map for what sections I could camp on. Eventually, I found a tiny spot that would fit me, though it was
still under some trees that I could not discern the health of. The evening settled in, and I was treated to demonic cows
mooing their displeasure, wolves howling their intent to feast, and the farmer's dogs barking back their warnings.

The next morning, I reached the road leading to Chester and quickly got a hitch from the owner of the Antlers Motel, who
was dropping Floss off. We joked about how we never actually saw the other person on trail. At this point, the majority
of the burn areas were finished, and I just needed one final burst of energy to get me through.
