I attempted to take a bus back from Mt Shasta to the trailhead, instead of a hitch. This ended with me walking along the
shoulder of the busyish I-5, hoping I didn't join the roadkill or get pulled over by a cop.

Making it back to Soda Springs Road, I looked at where I had left Northern California, in what felt like a lifetime ago.
Then, I turned back north, climbing into Castle Crags. The smoke was much better than yesterday, and I felt as though I
could at least hike without coughing.

As I ascended Castle Crags, the world behind me started to disappear and I soon found myself eerily alone on the trail.
On even the most obscure sections of the PCT, I'd at least see one or two other thru hikers during the day, but I hiked
for hours without seeing anyone.

This worked out in my favor, as I swatted away biting gnats, slapping my face as they entered my nostrils. I then
panicked as a sudden storm appeared as I was about to reach a very exposed saddle and ran back down to relative safety.

After the storm passed and I collected myself, I reluctantly climbed back up. The heat had only intensified during the
storm, and I found myself running out of water with few water sources remaining. One of the best sources I found was
quite fascinating, as it was surrounded by carnivorous cobra lilies, but the rest of the trail between here and Etna had
little reliable water.

The heat brought out the rattlesnakes, who welcomed me back to California, but the beginning of September also saw the
bears more active, as they attempted to find food before winter came. The sight of Mt Shasta kept me company, as the
bears and I rode the ledges north into Russian Wilderness.

This section had me at an all time low, as isolation and discomfort sunk deep into my soul. At one point, I broke down
and had to talk myself into continuing, as I was too tired to feel motivated on my own. After messaging Elleen on my
satellite device, I had enough strength to push on just a bit more. As I crossed an offroad vehicle trailhead, I
predictably saw nobody and my heart sank just a bit further, as I was dying for any conversation.

On the other side of the trailhead, I noticed someone had formed an arrow out of sticks, pointing to the right side of
the trail. I followed a few more arrows about 20 feet off the trail and found a lockbox someone had left, full of
Gatorades, snacks, and medical supplies. This brought me incredibly joy and tears to my eyes.

Over time, the air began to clear, but the stinging insects came out in force. I had gone from never being stung by any
bee, wasp, or hornet, to having several in a few hours. Still having not seen any other people for two days, I was
worried about having a reaction. Thankfully, I was about an hour out from a road that an emergency vehicle could likely
reach.

At the road, I finally met another person - a couple out on a day hike. They lived in Etna, the town I was going to
next, and the husband, Jerry, had hiked the PCT a few decades ago. Knowing they lived in Etna, I asked them for a favor.
The gear store closed early afternoon on Saturday and would be closed until Monday. As I was likely to reach Etna around
Saturday, although I was unsure as to what time I'd be able to find a hitch on the low traffic road that led to Etna, I
asked if I could pay them to purchase a fuel canister I needed and drop it off at the front desk of the motel I was
planning on staying at.

Jerry smiled and said "No, but I can buy one for you, not take your money, and give you a ride into town myself". With
his number in tow, I continued, thankful for this interaction. That evening, I found a campsite that absolutely would
have been packed normally, as it was in a perfect little nook of the woods, next to a beautiful creek. Instead, it was
eerily silent.

A little bit before Etna, I met Janika, who was similarly deprived of human contact for the last few days, and she spoke
nonstop for hours, as we hiked together. She had already managed to resupply at Etna, at the road where I met Jerry, so
she was planning on going ahead. When I arrived at the usual hitching spot to Etna, the road was empty so I called
Jerry.

About half an hour later, Jerry arrived to the trailhead with a fuel canister, ice cold sodas, and a few candy bars. I
gratefully accepted his gift and we drove into the town of Etna. Here, I learned that there was a supposedly a new fire
north of Seiad Valley, my next destination. Expecting this to close off the last little bit of Northern California and
with the fires still raging in Oregon, I figured that this would be the end. I was so sure this was the end, that I
fully decided and announced to some friends that I was done with the PCT.

Derek, who worked at the Etna motel, heard me out as I explained why I was quitting. He told me to wait for a little
bit, while he contacted some CalFire workers who were staying in town. They informed me that they didn't think the fire
reported above Seiad Valley existed and was instead an incorrectly filed report. That evening, it also started to rain
heavily in Oregon. These two factors gave me the tiniest sliver of hope and with that I left Etna to see what the
conditions were like in Seiad Valley.

The trail once again had no people, but instead multiple bear encounters. They weren't interested in me, however, and
made a beeline as I approached, as they hunted for more late season food. On the way to Seiad Valley, the trail became
overgrown with poison oak and avoiding the poison oak required keeping an eye out for rattlesnakes that hid right off
the side of the trail.

Eventually, I made it past the poison oak to an established campsite right outside of Seiad. The campsite was large and
well-used, but was completely empty when I spent the night there.

Early in the morning, I was packing up and perked up the the voice of Stellar Jay, coming down the trail behind me. She
introduced me to her hiking partner, Unfiltered, and I realized that I had already met Unfiltered. Not on the PCT, but
during a winter hiking skills course in Colorado earlier that year.

We walked down to Seiad Valley, chasing off the neighborhood dogs who desperately wanted to bite us, ignoring the stares
of the less than hospitable locals. The general store, despite being partially closed due to illness, was much more
welcoming, and we hung out at the picnic tables until the worst of the heat passed.

The ridge climb out of Seiad Valley was a challenge, but before too long we found a large flat area above a spring and
spread out our camping gear for the evening. Late in the evening, some southbound hikers joined us and we congratulated
them on making to California, and they congratulated us on almost finishing.

I got stung several more times, on my last day in California, which left me semi-delirious. This surreal feeling was
only heightened when I suddenly heard bells all around me, with no clear source in sight. Eventually, I realized that
the trail went through a cow field, and the creepy bell noises were actually from cowbells.

As I made the final climb out of California, to the Oregon border, I was reunited with Janika, and we sat for a
prolonged time until Unfiltered and Stellar Jay joined us. After reflecting for a little bit more, we raced out of
California, and the trail eventually took us to Highway 99, where I got a ride to Ashland.
