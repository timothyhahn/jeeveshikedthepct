In Yakima, I finally had a chance to get checked out, who found I had mild stomach bleed. With a few
more tests and probes, we eventually realized that the Ibuprofen I had been taking since Cispus Pass
was causing issues for me. I've always had problems with NSAIDs, but I thought such a small amount
of Advil, especially taken with food, wouldn't be an issue. I ended up spending two full days of
rest in Yakima and I gradually regained my appetite. It wouldn't come back fully for another week or
so, but the rest did me a world of good. I was sad that I was no longer hiking with Shapes and
Magma, but grateful for friends like Elleen who went to so much trouble to help me out on trail.
