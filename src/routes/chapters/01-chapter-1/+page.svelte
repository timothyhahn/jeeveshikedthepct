	The day before I started I, like many hundreds before me, made my way through San Diego to the
	house of Scout and Frodo's, trail angels who have graciously allowed hikers to stay at their place
	and prepare for the journey ahead.

	On May 1st, we quietly packed our bags well before the sun rose and made our ways into the cars of
	volunteers who drove us down to the Mexican border, where we began. On the first major climb out,
	I was overtaken by the charming and vivacious Flamingo Kid, who quickly out hiked me.

	Carrying far too much food and pushing myself during the heat, this first day was by far the
	hardest physically and I made it to the shade and protection of Hauser Creek, at the bottom of the
	climb to Lake Morena, with shoulders that doubted this entire endeavor. Here, I camped with Ant
	Man, Black Widow, her friend Willow, Giggles, Tiny Dancer, B&E, Flamingo Kid, and Misplaced. The
	day before we just met as strangers, that night we began our trail family.
</ParagraphWithImages>
<Paragraph
	>After a quick stop in Lake Morena for hot food, despite still having too much in my pack, I met
	Dobby, and the rest of the group met Adventure Time who advised us to meet up with him later in
	the day at Kitchen Creek. There, we were able to cool off after a long day of hiking in the creek,
	setup camp next to the waters, and sleep to the sound of croaking frogs.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>We left the desert floor to enter the beautiful pine forests of Mount Laguna, where Black Widow,
	Giggles, and I shared a tiny home, cramming our sleeping pads next to each other, awaking with
	each crinkle as we tossed and turned.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>The next day, we stepped north of town and looked over the Anza-Borrego desert, where we were
	about to enter.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>Seventeen miles later, we filled up on water at a questionable cistern and ate a quick dinner. As
	I left, a truck that was zooming by screeched to a halt, where a man poked his head out. Noticing
	my hiking attire, he asked me if I wanted an extremely cold beer. I declined, but he then tried
	offering an orange, which I happily agreed to as he got out and opened a cooler full of ice.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>We had one more day to Scissor's Crossing, where we were to attempt our first hitchhike into the
	town of Julian, but the group got a bit mixed up as several members took the wrong route in the
	dark of the early morning. We were reunited under the bridge at Scissor's Crossing, where hikers
	sprawled around a water cache maintained by the locals, and slept off the heat of the day.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>Eventually, we all got rides into Julian, including some of us from a legendary local trail angel
	named Ghost, where we immediately stopped by Mom's, who provided all hikers with a permit a free
	slice of pie, where I grabbed a table with Adventure Time, White Stripe, Little Hamster, and
	Butters. Little Hamster, who I met under the bridge, and I convinced each other that we both had
	deserved a nice place in town to stay and we grabbed separate rooms at a local AirBnB, while the
	rest of my gang stayed at the lodge. We all met up later for Cinco de Mayo margaritas and dinner.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>A local gear outfitter, Two Foot Adventure, arranged rides for us back to Scissor's Crossing, and
	unlike the rest of my group I waited until the sun started to set to hike. I passed my group
	setting up camp a few miles later, but as the climb to third gate water cache was notably brutal
	in the sun, I hiked well into the dark, passing Dobby's campsite in the dark, and called my friend
	from work, Elleen, to ease my nerves as the wind picked up. Eventually, I camped just before the
	water cache, which was immaculately maintained by local volunteers, including Ghost.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>The next day, we passed the mile 100 marker and celebrated with a trip to Montezuma Market a mile
	later, where we snacked and drank outside the shop to our heart's content, meeting AKA.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>Past the cow fields, we set up camp at a dried out creek bed and agreed to do a quick out and
	back to Eagle Rock, where we watched the sun set and the stars come out.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>At this point, I'd be remiss to not mention that my stomach was treating me poorly and I was
	unable to eat more than a thousand calories each day and the next few days were painful, as cramps
	wracked me with every step.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>Over the next two days met Dylan, a wildland firefighter carrying a full-size chainsaw to raise
	awareness for mental health among firefighters, gratefully got water from caches at Mike's and
	Mary's, received trail magic from Lifeguard and Zelda, and saw more rattlesnakes each day than I
	had seen on trails up until now.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph
	>After crawling into Paradise Valley Cafe, I ate the largest salad I could stomach, and we
	received a very kind hitch into the town of Idyllwild, where we were reunited with Flamingo Kid.
	Ant Man, AKA, Black Widow, Willow, Giggles, Little Hamster, and I rented a beautiful cabin in town
	and planned for our first full rest day.
