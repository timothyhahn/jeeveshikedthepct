From May 01, 2022 to October 01, 2022, I hiked the roughly 2,650-mile long Pacific Crest Trail,
which spans from the California/Mexico border to the Washington/Canada border.

Through the deserts, mountains, forests, and beyond, I shared this journey with hundreds of other
amazing hikers.

Although not everything went according to plan, I had an unforgettable summer and wanted to
capture my experience here.

A few quick notes before we start.

First, I’m going to do my best to keep my writing short. Normally, my writing style is quite
effusive, but I mostly wanted to share what was unique to my trip, as well as some photographs I
took along the way.

I will also focus on highlights from my trip, which means cutting out a lot of hiking, despite it
being most of the experience. This will give the impression that the PCT is just walking from
town, to point of interest, to another town, which is definitely not the case. It just better
matches my memories.

I adapted much of my writing here from a daily online journal I kept. Originally, I planned on
simply rewriting it, but found that the level of detail I wrote day by day varied. I also noticed
that most entries began with “I woke up early”.

To save you from that, I’ve rewritten the entire experience from scratch. You may also assume from
here on out that I woke up early, unless otherwise noted.

Finally, I will be using everyone’s “trail names”, where applicable. Trail names are a long
distance hiking tradition, where instead of sharing our real names, we give each other nicknames
based on some attribute or anecdote from the trail.

For example, my trail name was “Ask Jeeves”, though most people shortened it to just Jeeves. This
is in reference to my habit of always having an answer to a question asked out loud, as well as
questions not asked.
