Once in Bend, we went over to the grocery store. As Bend is by far a much larger city than anything else I had set foot
in over the past few months, this experience was overwhelming. We decided to make the most of this time together,
however, and enjoyed cooking for each other, as well as ordering meals we had been dreaming about every day on the PCT.

I also had the pleasure of meeting Morgan, of Blaze Physio, who crashed with us for a bit, and was also reunited with
Dobby. As I had shipped out my resupply and was ready to start hiking again, however, I soon said goodbye.

Little Hamster graciously drove myself, Floss, and Shapes to Timberline Lodge, dropping Floss off at Government Camp on
the way, where we once again restarted our hike northbound.
