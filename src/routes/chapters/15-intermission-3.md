title: 'Intermission 3 - Seattle, Ashland, and Mt Shasta'
part: 'end'

When we reached Seattle, we helped the hikers who rode in with us find accommodations. I had booked a hotel near the
airport, so Shapes insisted on driving me personally from his home in Marysville. We picked up some food on the way back
and we hugged goodbye, as we had different plans on how to tackle the remaining miles on the trail.

Bandit and I had planned to reconnect once we reached Seattle, so we hung out with one of her friends. Interestingly, I
found out her friend was not only a coworker, but someone I had guided through the interview process a year before. I
also met up with another coworker who had just started on my team who lived in the area.

Surprisingly, all of Northern California and most of Oregon had reopened. With this in mind, I originally planned to fly
to Redding or take the train back to Dunsmuir/Mt Shasta. Checking on a whim, however, I noticed that a rental car from
Seattle to Redding was just a few dollars a day. I rented the car and first drove down to Ashland.

I would return to Ashland before too long via the trail, but this time was just to plan for my final leg of the journey
and spent the night before continuing back to Northern California. I dropped off my car in Redding and got a ride back
to where I had left the trail in Mt Shasta. I took an extra day to rest in Mt Shasta, as a heat wave brought 100 degree
temps and intensified the fire and smoke along the trail.
